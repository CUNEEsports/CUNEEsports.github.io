                <h5><b>Why did you choose Concordia?</b></h5>
                <p>I came here cause of the size of the campus. I also liked how much the community is involved. </p>

                <br>

                <h5><b>Why did you choose Esports?</b></h5>
                <p>I chose Esports because of my experience in streaming to help cast. I wasn’t originally looking to
                    play since I would only be a Rocket League sub. </p>

                <br>

                <h5><b>What other hobbies do you enjoy?</b></h5>
                <p>I play a lot of Minecraft and War Thunder when I’m not playing League. I like to build structures and
                    try to engineer how to make things with Jenga blocks or what is available.</p>

                <br>

                <h5><b>Favorite memory about Esports so far?</b></h5>
                <p>The Valorant Finals game is currently my favorite. The crazy 9-3 curse coming through was crazy.</p>
