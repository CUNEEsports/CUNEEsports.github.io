                <h5><b>Why did you choose Concordia?</b></h5>
                <p>I choose Concordia because I wanted a small school with Christian values. I also chose Concordia
                    because of the shooting sports team which is my primary sport. I like the computer science and math
                    programs here as well.</p>

                <br>

                <h5><b>Why did you choose Esports?</b></h5>
                <p>I chose to join esports this year because I enjoy playing games in my free time. The team competed on
                    the games I enjoy playing so I thought I would join the team to try it.</p>

                <br>

                <h5><b>What other hobbies do you enjoy?</b></h5>
                <p>Another hobby I enjoy is shooting sports. Skeet shooting is my favorite but I enjoy sporting as well.

                <h5><b>Favorite memory about Esports so far?</b></h5>
                <p>My favorite memory since joining the esports team is meeting new people and playing games with them.
                    I havenâ€™t been on the team for too long but it has been fun so far having teammates to play with.
